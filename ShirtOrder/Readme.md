# Shirt Order 
This is a super simple program that simulates ordering a shirt. 
This was one of my first programs that I built in CPP
This program was built to show my understand of functions, passing by reference and passing by value 

At the start of the program the user will be asked if they are ready to check out. 
Upon entering yes (Y) the program will enter a while loop. 
Within that while loop is the meat of the program. 
The while contains three functions that a get the user input, calculates the prices, and displays the price.
