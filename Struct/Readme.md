# Objective
This program demostrates my understanding of structs in C++
This program reads from an infile called "students.txt" 
The infile contains information about the student on three seperate lines

# Students.txt
The text file contains the information for 6 different students.
Each students information spans across three rows
On the first row is the student's name 
On the second row are two scores, the first being the midterm score and the second the final exam score.
The third row contains four lab scores.

# The Program
The program contains a "Student" struct.
The struct contains a sting and 7 doubles
The objective of this program is to read in the students information from the infile and calculate the weighted total and letter grade. 
First the program will read in one student at a time and build the struct accordingly.
